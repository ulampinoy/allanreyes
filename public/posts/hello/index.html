                <p>Thanks for dropping by my site. It is currently going under a total revamp, so please bear with me for all the rough edges here and there.</p>
<p>But no more excuses. It has been long been overdued. Previously, I am very reluctant and fearful to the idea of releasing something that is not pixel-perfect. I now know better, unicorn is a myth and pixel-perfect is a unicorn.</p>
<p>I will rebuild it with a renewed zeal. The goal is ship regularly instead of having it all figured out and perfect. It will be a work-in-progress(WIP) project.</p>
<p>This will be my personal journal on subjects that I care about and interested in. I now earn my living as a digital product designer so I will be posting my ideas, opinion and demos hoping to share the knowledge I found useful for the craft and hoping that it could be useful, one way or the other, to the members of the guild. It will be a learning lab to break things and try out experimental-stage stuff aiming to learn along the way.</p>
<p>It will also house my work portfolio showcasing most of my previous work.</p>
<p>Thanks again, please stay tuned and I&rsquo;ll see you next time!</p>
