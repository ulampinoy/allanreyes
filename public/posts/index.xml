      <description>Thanks for dropping by my site. It is currently going under a total revamp, so please bear with me for all the rough edges here and there.
But no more excuses. It has been long been overdued. Previously, I am very reluctant and fearful to the idea of releasing something that is not pixel-perfect. I now know better, unicorn is a myth and pixel-perfect is a unicorn.
I will rebuild it with a renewed zeal.</description>
