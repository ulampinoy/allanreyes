There is so much joy on rolling up your sleeves and getting your hands dirty to make something, anything.   _"There is a more joy in giving than in receiving,"_ these are wise words mentioned in the Bible. It proves very true being a **Maker.** A maker creates and then share his handcraft, giving it to others in effect. As we receive or consume these works we are delighted but even more the creator have more joy!

Making your own website gives you a profound sense of satisfaction. The process of making things is a happy journey of it's own. It will surely not be perfect but if I keep on going giving my very best perhaps I can make it better than what I've done previously, least I can do.

### What I Use
I have a simple pipeline.

I write locally to my heart's content using my new favorite text editor: Visual Studio Code by Microsoft (which let me think why Apple didn't came up with such tool knowing that they have better developer relationship in their ecosystem at least). For the record, this is the 3rd editor I fell in love with: TextMate > Sublime > VSCode.

I use Hugo to turn my writings to webpages. In some future post I will write in details how I did it but I can already tell you know that it is not that difficult, but well not super easy.

As for modern website creation you need to have a repository remotely not just sitting on your always vulnerable hard drive. I use GitHub for this necessity.

Then to share it to you, yes you, my friend who read this very word. I need to get it publish on the Web. Netlify picks up from here and does all the cool things that need to be done so your writings goes live. In another future post I will tell you how awesome Netlify is!

Recap. Locally I have Hugo running and I use Code to implement design and write the content. I then push it to GitHub and Netlify is always listening to get the go signal to run the mill, whenever there is a push to GitHub, Netlify will build something fresh for your site. Very cool!
